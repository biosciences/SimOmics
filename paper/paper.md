# Summary

SimOmics is an R package designed to generate realistic, multivariate, and multi-omics synthetic datasets. It is intended for use in benchmarking, method development, and reproducibility in bioinformatics, particularly in the context of omics integration tasks such as those encountered in transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. SimOmics supports latent factor simulation, sparsity structures, block-wise covariance modeling, and biologically inspired noise models and feature dimensions.

# Statement of need

Simulated datasets play a crucial role in statistical method development, especially in fields such as systems biology and multi-omics integration, where complex relationships often exist between multiple data modalities. However, existing simulation tools are either too simple (e.g., based on basic multivariate distributions) or lack support for biologically relevant structures such as sparsity, block integration, or shared latent variables.

SimOmics fills this gap by providing an accessible yet powerful framework to generate synthetic multi-omics datasets that resemble real biological complexity. This is critical for the testing and benchmarking of methods like mixOmics [@rohart2017mixomics], MOFA2 [@argelaguet2020mofa2], and iCluster [@wang2014iclatplus].

# Features

- Simulate multiple omics blocks with flexible dimensions
- Inject shared latent factors or independent noise
- Control inter-block correlation via a block covariance structure
- Add Gaussian noise and customize signal-to-noise ratio
- Plot PCA, correlation, and integration results
- Export data and integrate with other packages like `mixOmics`

# Why Simulated Data Matters

Simulated datasets—when designed to reflect realistic biological complexity—are essential tools in bioinformatics research [@zhang2020synthetic; @huang2017systematic]. SimOmics enables users to generate such datasets for a range of multivariate and multi-omics scenarios.

## Advantages of synthetic datasets:

- **Method development**: Early-stage algorithm development benefits from controllable data without needing access to real datasets [@witten2009penalized].
- **Known ground truth**: Simulated data allow researchers to benchmark models based on sensitivity, specificity, and overall performance with known signal.
- **Stress-testing**: Users can design edge-case scenarios (e.g., high noise, low correlation, small sample size) not typically found in public datasets [@teschendorff2018statistical].
- **Reproducibility**: Synthetic data ensures that benchmarking can be reproduced across institutions and software implementations.

# Use cases and target audience

SimOmics is intended for:

- Researchers developing new multi-omics integration methods
- Developers of machine learning models for high-dimensional data
- Authors writing benchmarking papers that require known ground truth
- Bioinformatics instructors demonstrating omics integration techniques

Users include PhD students, statisticians, and software developers in computational biology. Although it is not aimed at experimental biologists, it is a valuable tool for method validation and reproducible research.

# Related work

Several existing R packages such as `clusterGeneration`, `bnlearn`, and `simuPOP` support general-purpose simulation of data. However, none offer block-wise omics simulation with latent factors and realistic biological noise models. SimOmics builds on the need observed in published tools such as mixOmics [@rohart2017mixomics], MOFA2 [@argelaguet2020mofa2], and iCluster [@wang2014iclatplus] to benchmark model performance in structured settings.

# Example Use Case

The following figure shows the result of applying `mixOmics::block.plsda()` to two synthetic omics blocks (transcriptome and proteome) generated by SimOmics. Class labels A and B are partially separable, reflecting shared latent structure while preserving variability.
